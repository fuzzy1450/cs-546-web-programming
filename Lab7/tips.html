                <h3>Play with your team!</h3>
                <p>Your most powerful weapon is your fellow contestants. Treat your teammates like lighthouses, and let the flash of their gunfire protect you from the rocky shores of defeat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Go for the Revive!</h3>
                <p>If a teammate is down, prioritize picking them back up. No option can tip the scales like a good revive.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Punish the Revive!</h3>
                <p>If you just got a pick, be sure to camp the poor sap's trophy. If their team is decent, their teammate will be by soon. Make them regret it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Goo is OP!</h3>
                <p>Instant defense, versatile movement option, and it can even stop thieves. Goo will get the job done, whatever that job may be.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Rhythm Wins Fights!</h3>
                <p>Your opponent could be cheating, but even aimhacks wont help him shoot through your cover. Practice patience under fire, and only shoot when they need to reload.</p>
            </li>
