                <p>Got stunned by a light, couldnt deploy a shield to save myself. I am annoyed by tiny pebbles making sheild-placements invalid. I am more annoyed by how easy the stun gun is to use, vs the advantage it grants.</p>

                <p>Threw an anti-gravity cube at the powershift puck while it was over a chasm on Seoul. The enemy team got picked up by the cube, and the puck kept moving. 3 People fell into the chasm below, and we got the puck back.</p>
